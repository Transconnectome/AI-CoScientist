Implications for Published Literature and Field-Wide Reproducibility

Our finding that 50% of single-seed GRF models fail calibration tests raises urgent questions about the reliability of existing literature. We systematically reviewed all 15 studies in Table 1 applying GRF to psychological and neuroscience questions, examining their reporting practices for seed robustness and calibration diagnostics.

Literature Review Findings:

Methodological Transparency Assessment:
‚Ä¢ 3/15 (20%) reported seed ensemble or multi-seed robustness checks
‚Ä¢ 2/15 (13%) reported calibration test results (Œ≤‚ÇÅ and Œ≤‚ÇÇ with p-values)
‚Ä¢ 0/15 (0%) reported both ensemble approach AND comprehensive calibration diagnostics
‚Ä¢ 10/15 (67%) did not report random seed values used for model training
‚Ä¢ 12/15 (80%) did not discuss sensitivity of findings to random initialization

Reproducibility Risk Assessment:

Without seed robustness checks, we cannot determine whether published findings would replicate across random initializations. Given our empirical finding of 50% calibration failure rate for single-seed models, the existing literature faces three possible scenarios:

1. Optimistic Scenario: Studies happened to use "good" seeds by chance ‚Üí findings remain valid despite incomplete reporting
2. Pessimistic Scenario: Results were influenced by favorable seed selection (intentional or inadvertent) ‚Üí some findings may not replicate
3. Most Likely Scenario: Mixed picture where some published findings are robust to seed variation while others are seed-dependent, but current reporting standards prevent distinguishing between them

The third scenario is most concerning for scientific progress. When a field cannot systematically identify which findings are robust versus fragile, replication efforts become inefficient, meta-analyses may be biased, and clinical translation is delayed. This is not a failure of individual researchers but a gap in methodological standards that has gone unrecognized.

Quantifying the Literature Impact:

Applying our 50% failure rate to the 15 studies reviewed (representing hundreds of published HTE analyses across psychology and neuroscience):

‚Ä¢ Conservative estimate: 30-40% of published GRF findings may show different statistical significance with alternative random seeds
‚Ä¢ Effect on meta-analyses: Published effect sizes may overestimate true effects if only "successful" seeds reached publication
‚Ä¢ Replication implications: Failed replications of GRF studies may reflect seed dependence rather than true null effects
‚Ä¢ Clinical translation delays: Biomarkers and treatment moderators identified in seed-dependent analyses may not validate in independent samples

This is particularly critical for high-stakes applications. For example, if neurobiological markers predicting treatment response in depression are identified using single-seed GRF (as in several reviewed studies), clinical validation trials may fail not because the biology is wrong but because the original discovery was seed-dependent. The opportunity cost of pursuing non-robust markers is substantial: years of follow-up research, clinical trial resources, and delayed benefit to patients.

Path Forward: Establishing Field Standards

We propose three tiers of action to address this reproducibility gap:

Immediate Actions (Applicable Now):

1. Mandatory Reporting: All future GRF applications should report either:
   a) Seed ensemble approach (minimum 3-5 seeds) with merged forest details, OR
   b) Robustness analysis across ‚â•10 random seeds showing consistent calibration

2. Methodological Transparency Requirements:
   - Random seed values documented in Methods section
   - Full calibration diagnostics reported (Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ, standard errors, p-values)
   - Sensitivity analysis if single-seed approach is used
   - Computational code and random seeds shared for reproducibility verification

3. Reviewer Guidelines: Journals should require reviewers to check:
   - Whether seed robustness is addressed
   - Whether calibration diagnostics support claimed findings
   - Whether code availability enables independent verification

Short-Term Field Initiatives (1-2 years):

1. Methodological Papers: Publish technical guidelines for optimal seed ensemble implementation across different sample sizes and covariate dimensions

2. Replication Studies: Systematically re-analyze published datasets (where available) using seed ensemble framework to assess which findings are robust versus seed-dependent

3. Standardized Reporting Checklist: Develop consensus guidelines (similar to CONSORT for RCTs or STROBE for observational studies) specific to causal ML applications

Long-Term Systemic Changes (2-5 years):

1. Software Integration: Implement seed ensemble as default in causal ML packages (e.g., grf R package could add ensemble_grf() function with automatic merging)

2. Education and Training: Incorporate algorithmic stability concepts into graduate curricula for quantitative psychology, computational neuroscience, and biostatistics

3. Registered Reports: Encourage pre-registration of GRF analysis plans including seed robustness strategies, reducing flexibility that could lead to seed p-hacking

4. Retrospective Validation Initiative: Coordinate multi-lab effort to re-evaluate key published findings using standardized seed ensemble approach, publishing results regardless of outcome to establish ground truth for field

Expected Field-Wide Benefits:

By establishing seed ensemble stability as standard practice, the field can expect:

‚Ä¢ Increased replication success rates: Robust findings will replicate consistently across labs
‚Ä¢ Faster clinical translation: Validated biomarkers will progress through development pipeline more reliably
‚Ä¢ Improved resource allocation: Research efforts focused on reproducible effects rather than seed-dependent artifacts
‚Ä¢ Enhanced public trust: Transparent, reproducible methods strengthen credibility of behavioral science
‚Ä¢ Cross-method learning: Lessons from GRF stability apply to other causal ML methods (causal forests, BART, DR-learner)

Constructive Perspective:

This is not a crisis of science but a crisis of methodological maturity. Many fields face similar challenges when powerful new methods are adopted before best practices are established. By identifying the problem clearly and providing a proven, accessible solution, we enable the field to move forward with confidence. The path to reliable causal machine learning is now clear: ensemble stability should become standard practice, not an optional enhancement.

The alternative‚Äîcontinuing with current practices‚Äîrisks accumulating non-reproducible findings that erode trust in precision behavioral science just as it promises to transform clinical practice and policy. By acting decisively now, the field can establish GRF and related causal ML methods as trustworthy tools for discovery, ensuring that the next decade of applications builds on solid foundations rather than stochastic sand.
