    assert features.shape == (20,)
    assert features.dtype == torch.float32

def test_extract_features_normalized(extractor, sample_text):
    features = extractor.extract(sample_text)
    assert torch.all(features >= 0.0)
    assert torch.all(features <= 1.0)

def test_academic_word_detection(extractor):
    academic_text = "This research analyzes significant evidence..."

    ai_scores = [7, 8, 9, 6, 10]
    qwk = PaperMetrics.quadratic_weighted_kappa(human_scores, ai_scores)
    assert 0.95 <= qwk <= 1.0  # Perfect agreement

def test_calculate_accuracy_with_tolerance():
    true_scores = [7, 8, 9, 6, 10]
    pred_scores = [8, 9, 10, 7, 9]  # All off by 1
    accuracy = PaperMetrics.calculate_accuracy(true_scores, pred_scores, tolerance=1)
    assert accuracy == 1.0  # All within ±1
```

## Current Test Status

### ❌ Cannot Run Tests Yet
**Reason**: Dependencies not installed in poetry environment

**Error**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'
```

**Root Cause**: `poetry.lock` file outdated after adding dependencies to `pyproject.toml`

## Required Actions Before Testing

### 1. Update Poetry Lock File
```bash
poetry lock
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

### 3. Download Models (for integration tests)
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
# Run SOTA unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_sota/ -v --cov=src/services/paper

# Run with coverage report
poetry run pytest tests/test_sota/ --cov=src/services/paper --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_sota/test_metrics.py -v
```

- Metrics: >95% coverage

## Additional Test Recommendations

### Integration Tests (Priority: High)
1. **End-to-End Quality Assessment**
   ```python
   async def test_full_quality_assessment_pipeline():
       # Test GPT-4 → SciBERT → Ensemble flow
       paper_id = create_test_paper()
       result = await analyzer.analyze_quality(paper_id)
       assert "quality_score" in result
       assert "analysis_methods" in result
   ```

2. **Hybrid Model Integration**
   ```python
   async def test_hybrid_model_scoring():
       # Test RoBERTa + Linguistic features → Quality score
       text = load_sample_paper()
       score = await hybrid_scorer.score_paper(text)
       assert 1.0 <= score["overall_quality"] <= 10.0
   ```

3. **Review Generation**
   ```python
   async def test_automated_review_generation():
       # Test full review pipeline
       review = await generator.generate_review(paper_id)
       assert "scores" in review
       assert "strengths" in review["review"]
       assert "weaknesses" in review["review"]
   ```

### Performance Tests (Priority: Medium)
1. **Inference Speed Benchmarking**
   ```python
   def test_linguistic_features_performance():
       # Ensure feature extraction completes in <100ms
       text = load_large_paper()
       start = time.time()
       features = extractor.extract(text)
       duration = time.time() - start
       assert duration < 0.1  # 100ms
   ```

2. **Model Optimization Validation**
   ```python
   def test_quantized_model_accuracy():
       # Ensure <5% accuracy loss after quantization
       original_score = model.score_paper(text)
       quantized_score = quantized_model.score_paper(text)
       assert abs(original_score - quantized_score) < 0.5
   ```

### Edge Case Tests (Priority: Medium)
1. **Very short papers** (<500 words)
2. **Very long papers** (>50,000 words)
3. **Non-English text** (error handling)
4. **Malformed input** (missing sections, corrupted text)
