Measures:

- Genomic data (polygenic risk scores)
- Structural MRI scans
- Psychotic-like experiences assessment

We employed instrumental variable (IV) forest methodology to address potential confounding from unobserved factors. This quasi-experimental approach allows causal inference while accounting for complex gene-environment interactions.""",

Our analysis revealed significant interactions between neighborhood adversity and both genetic and neural factors in predicting PLEs.

Key Findings:
1. Higher neighborhood adversity associated with increased PLEs (Œ≤ = 0.34, p < 0.001)

3. Brain structure metrics (particularly in prefrontal regions) showed moderating effects
4. IV forest approach confirmed causal relationships while controlling for confounding

This study provides evidence for neuro-genetic susceptibility to neighborhood socioeconomic adversity in children's psychotic-like experiences. Our findings have several important implications:

1. Personalized Intervention: Children with higher genetic or neural vulnerability may benefit from targeted interventions when living in adverse neighborhoods.

2. Policy Implications: Understanding these susceptibility factors can inform public health policies aimed at protecting vulnerable children.

3. Mechanistic Insights: The results suggest that gene-environment interactions operate through neural pathways to influence mental health outcomes.

Limitations include the cross-sectional design and potential selection bias. Future research should examine longitudinal trajectories and test intervention strategies.""",

Children's environments profoundly shape their lifelong trajectories across health, economic, and social domains. Exposure to adverse conditions‚Äîincluding poverty, malnutrition, abuse, and unsafe neighborhoods‚Äîsignificantly elevates risks for mental and physical health disorders, cognitive impairments, and maladaptive behaviors.

This investigation examines the interplay between neighborhood socioeconomic adversity and genetic/neural factors in shaping children's psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). Leveraging instrumental variable (IV) forest methodology with ABCD Study data, we elucidate these intricate gene-environment-brain interactions.

Our findings advance mechanistic understanding of how environmental adversity influences developmental and mental health outcomes in genetically and neurally susceptible children.""",

Our findings provide compelling evidence for neuro-genetic susceptibility moderating the impact of neighborhood socioeconomic adversity on children's psychotic-like experiences. Three key implications emerge:

First, the identification of genetic and neural vulnerability markers enables precision-targeted interventions. Children exhibiting these susceptibility factors may derive maximal benefit from enhanced support when residing in adverse neighborhoods.

Second, these findings inform evidence-based public health policy. Understanding susceptibility heterogeneity allows resource allocation toward protecting the most vulnerable children.

Third, our results illuminate mechanistic pathways: gene-environment interactions manifest through neural architecture to shape mental health trajectories.

Study limitations‚Äînotably cross-sectional design and potential selection bias‚Äîsuggest caution in causal interpretation. Longitudinal research examining developmental trajectories and intervention efficacy represents a critical next step."""
