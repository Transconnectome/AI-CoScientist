     35 Abstract 36 Socioeconomic deprivation is linked to psychiatric vulnerability in children, yet the 37 sources of individual variability remain unclear. Using an instrumental‚Äëvariable random‚Äëforest 38 framework (IV Forest) in a longitudinal cohort of 2,135 children, we estimate the association 39 between neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and delay discounting and psychotic‚Äëlike 40 experiences (PLEs) using variation in neighborhood adversity induced by state 41 source‚Äëof‚Äëincome anti‚Äëdiscrimination laws. Under standard IV assumptions, higher 42 neighborhood adversity relates to steeper delay discounting and higher PLEs on average, and 43 these associations vary systematically across children. These findings support the behavioral 44 poverty trap framework, which is a self-reinforcing cycle where poverty-induced psychological 45 distress relates to decisions that may perpetuate economic hardship. Moving beyond average 46 relationships, an integrated IV Forest model that combines delay discounting, prefrontal‚Äëlimbic 47 morphometry, reward‚Äëtask activation, and polygenic scores delineates marked significant 48 heterogeneity in associations between neighborhood adversity and PLEs across children. 49 Children most vulnerable to neighborhood adversity showed a paradoxical pattern: higher 50 genetic predisposition for cognitive achievement (GPS for cognitive performance, IQ, and 51 educational attainment) combined with specific limbic alterations (reduced volumes, 52 heightened reward-related activation). These findings challenge diathesis-stress models and 53 support differential susceptibility theory. By identifying who is most vulnerable to 54 neighborhood disadvantage and why, our results inform precision-medicine approaches to 55 preventing childhood psychopathology and breaking cycles of socioeconomic disadvantage. 56  57 58

    Introduction 59 A child's environment is a powerful predictor of their lifelong health and economic 60 outcomes. Adverse childhood environments, such as low family income, malnutrition, physical 61 or sexual abuse, and unsafe neighborhoods, are linked to an heightened risk of various mental 62 or physical health issues, including psychosis (1-3), impoverished cognitive ability (1-3), 63 anxiety, bipolar disorder, self-harm, depression (4-6), substance abuse, and obesity (2, 3, 7). 64 Furthermore, these environments are associated with negative social outcomes, such as poor 65 academic performance (8, 9), low income, unemployment (10, 11), higher rates of 66 imprisonment, and increased likelihood of teen pregnancy (12, 13). Additionally, exposure to 67 these adverse conditions in childhood is associated with a propensity for engaging in risky 68 behaviors, including criminal activity (13, 14), excessive consumption of calorie-dense foods 69 (15), substance use (16, 17), deficient self-control (18), and disrupted reward processing (19).  70 One prominent framework, the ‚Äúbehavioral poverty trap,‚Äù posits that exposure to 71 socioeconomic deprivation alters reward valuation, promoting impulsive decision-making that 72 can lead to a range of suboptimal behavior and outcomes (20, 21). Individuals with steeper 73 discounting of future rewards (i.e., value present rewards much higher than future rewards) are 74 more likely to save less, invest less in their education, engage in criminal activities, exhibit 75 lower academic performance, and accumulate less economic wealth (20, 22-24). Such 76 impairments in intertemporal valuation are not only associated with financial and social 77 disadvantages but are also linked to psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, attention 78 deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and addiction (25, 26).  79 In this paper, we focused on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) as a key psychiatric 80

    outcome. Around 17% of 9-12 years old children report PLEs (27), individuals with PLEs at 81 age 11 had greater risk of developing psychosis in adulthood (28, 29). Prior studies revealed 82 that PLEs are correlated to heightened vulnerability to other psychopathologies (30) including 83 suicidal behavior (1), mood, anxiety, and substance disorders (31-33) and exhibit the strongest 84 association with environmental risk factors in comparison to other internalizing/externalizing 85 symptoms during adolescence (2).  86 The link between deprivation and PLEs is likely moderated by core neurodevelopmental 87 processes, and we propose that delay discounting provides a critical window into these 88 mechanisms (31, 34, 35). Delay discounting, which is evidenced by the extent to which 89 individuals‚Äô discount future rewards, pertains to their intertemporal decision-making and 90 impulsive behavior. This measure of intertemporal choice is not merely a behavioral quirk but 91 a quantifiable index of reward valuation governed by prefrontal-limbic circuits (25, 26). 92 Children who experienced social adversities show steeper discounting of future rewards in 93 adulthood (36, 37) and have higher PLEs (1, 2, 38). Comparative studies have demonstrated 94 that individuals with psychosis discount future rewards more steeply than healthy controls (31, 95 34, 35), a pattern that is uniquely pronounced in psychosis compared to other 96 psychopathologies such as primary mood disorders (34), major depressive disorder (34), and 97 bipolar disorder (35). Crucially, the same mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems that 98 regulate reward anticipation are heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis (1, 2, 99 38). This shared neurobiological foundation suggests that individual differences in these reward 100 circuits could be a key mechanism determining how environmental stress translates into 101 psychiatric symptoms. 102 This raises the central puzzle in developmental science: why do some children exhibit 103

    remarkable resilience to adversity while others are exquisitely vulnerable? Answering this 104 requires dissecting individual-level heterogeneity, which likely arises from a complex interplay 105 of genetic predispositions and neurodevelopmental factors (39-41). Traditional linear models 106 are ill-equipped for this task, as they struggle to capture the high-dimensional, nonlinear gene-107 environment interactions that likely define a child's vulnerability (42, 43). 108 Here, we address this challenge by applying a causal machine learning framework to rich, 109 longitudinal, multi-modal data‚Äîincluding genomics, structural and functional MRI, and 110 behavior‚Äîfrom children aged 9-12 years old in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 111 (ABCD) Study. Using instrumental variable (IV) random forests (henceforth IV Forest) (30, 112 44), we move beyond population-level associations to characterize the specific neuro-genetic 113 patterns associated with vulnerability to the psychiatric risks of socioeconomic adversity. We 114 focus specifically on neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation because it represents a critical 115 environmental layer beyond individual family status. Neighborhood adversities during 116 childhood have been associated with maladaptive neurocognitive development (6, 45, 46), 117 psychiatric disorders (28, 29), and unfavorable social outcomes such as decreased income, 118 reduced probability of college attendance, and limited employment opportunities (47, 48). This 119 phenomenon is particularly pronounced in societies where housing discrimination based on 120 family income or race/ethnicity restricts underprivileged families from selecting 121 neighborhoods that present greater opportunities for upward social mobility, as observed in the 122 United States (47). 123 This study first estimates the IV-based association between neighborhood socioeconomic 124 deprivation, steeper delay discounting, and elevated PLEs. We then document heterogeneity in 125 this link and observe a multi-modal pattern of vulnerability characterized by specific genetic 126

    predispositions, and limbic system structures and functions. Within this pattern, we found a 127 paradoxical finding: a higher genetic predisposition for cognitive achievement is positively‚Äî128 rather than negatively‚Äîrelated to the psychiatric risks of a deprived socioeconomic 129 environment. 130   131

    Methods 132 Study Participants 133 The ABCD Study recruited participants from 21 research sites across the nation, utilizing 134 a stratified, probability sampling method to capture the sociodemographic variation of the US 135 population (49). We used the baseline, first year, and second year follow-up datasets included 136 in ABCD Release 4.0, downloaded on February 10, 2022.  137 To ensure the highest quality of data and internal validity for our analyses, we implemented 138 the standardized preprocessing and quality control pipelines recommended by the ABCD Study 139 consortium (50, 51). Of the initial 11,876 ABCD samples, participants not meeting the ABCD 140 Study‚Äôs MRI quality control standards (N=3,275) were excluded. Similarly, for the delay 141 discounting task, we applied the Johnson-Bickel validation criterion (52), as recommended by 142 the ABCD behavioral workgroup (51), to exclude participants with inconsistent responses (i.e., 143 indifferent point for a given delay larger than that of an indifference point for a longer delay) 144 (N=5,293). We also removed participants without genotype data, MRI data, NIH Toolbox 145 Cognitive Battery, delay discounting, residential address, ADI, and PLEs (N=1,173). Missing 146 values of covariates were imputed using k-nearest neighbors. The final samples included 2,135 147 children from a variety of race/ethnic groups (Fig. 1).  148  149 Data 150 Our primary exposure was neighborhood socioeconomic adversity, measured at baseline 151 using the national percentile scores of the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) (2, 45). The primary 152 outcomes were delay discounting, a model-free measure of reward impulsivity assessed at the 153

    1-year follow-up (51), and PLEs, measured using the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child 154 version at 1- and 2-year follow-ups (53). A lower value of delay discounting denotes steeper 155 discounting of future rewards; a higher value of PLE score indicates greater severity of PLEs. 156 To identify moderators of vulnerability, we utilized a rich, multi-modal dataset including 157 genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) for cognitive and psychiatric traits, structural MRI 158 measures of brain morphometry (50), and functional MRI data from a monetary incentive delay 159 (MID) task (50). Detailed descriptions of all measures, tasks, and MRI processing pipelines are 160 provided in the Supplementary Information. 161 To adjust for the potential confounding effects, sociodemographic covariates were 162 included. Consistent with existing research on psychiatric disorders in ABCD samples (2, 53-163 55), we controlled for the child‚Äôs sex, age, race/ethnicity, caregiver‚Äôs relationship to a child, 164 BMI, parental education, marital status of the caregiver, household income, parent‚Äôs age, and 165 family history of psychiatric disorders. The family history of psychiatric disorders, measured 166 as the proportion of first-degree relatives who experienced psychosis, depression, mania, 167 suicidality, previous hospitalization, or professional help for mental health issues (2) was 168 included as a covariate. Given that delay discounting and PLEs are associated with an 169 individual's neurocognitive capabilities (56-58), NIH Toolbox total intelligence was used as a 170 covariate. All covariates were from baseline year observations. 171  172 Statistical Analyses 173 Given the non-randomized, observational nature of the ABCD Study, potential 174 confounding factors, such as genetic, environmental variables, and their unobserved common 175

    causes, can lead to biased estimations (59). A powerful and effective way to adjust such bias is 176 the IV regression. Designed to isolate a quasi-random source of variation in the 177 treatment/exposure variable, IV regression is an effective method to conduct quasi-178 experimental analysis using non-randomized, observational data for research in various 179 domains, including economics (60, 61), psychology (62), neuroscience (63), and psychiatry 180 (64). 181 Our instrument is the presence of state-level source of income (SOI) laws at baseline year 182 assessment, which prohibit housing discrimination against voucher holders. These laws 183 increase the landlords‚Äô acceptance of housing vouchers, aiding low-income families in securing 184 quality housing. As such, SOI laws are critical in enabling better residential environments by 185 mitigating neighborhood socioeconomic adversity. That is, the implementation of these laws 186 provides a natural experiment: it strongly predicts a family's neighborhood adversity (i.e., ADI) 187 but is plausibly unrelated to the unobserved confounding factors that typically bias estimates. 188 The IV analysis leverages this exogenous variation from SOI laws to estimate the associations 189 of ADI with delay discounting and PLEs while mitigating bias from unobserved confounders 190 (see Fig. 2A). We present theoretical explanations of the IV method and detailed justification 191 of SOI laws as valid instrument in the Supplementary Information. 192 We used IV Forest (65, 66)‚Äîa random forest-based IV regression (60)‚Äîto adjust for 193 unobserved confounding bias in identifying the potential relationship of ADI with delay 194 discounting and PLEs. The IV Forest method provides nonparametric, doubly robust estimates 195 of the average (group-level) and heterogeneous (individual-level) associations of ADI with 196 these outcomes, interpreted under the IV assumptions (see Fig. 2B). This method is noted for 197 delivering estimates with significantly lower mean-squared error compared to conventional k-198

    nearest neighbor methods (65, 66). Furthermore, its use of independent subsamples for model 199 construction and validation ensures honest, overfitting-resistant estimates of average and 200 heterogeneous relationships (65-67). Notably, this method is particularly useful for analyzing 201 the complex, nonlinear interactions between genetic and environmental factors and their link 202 with neurocognitive development and PLEs, even within the confines of observational data 203 (65). We used cluster‚Äërobust inference with the ABCD Study site as the clustering unit for IV 204 Forest estimates. The technical description of the IV Forest algorithm is detailed in the 205 Supplementary Information. 206 Fig. 1 presents the analytical framework of our study, examining the associations of 207 neighborhood socioeconomic adversity with children's decision-making and mental health. 208 ADI, recorded in the baseline year, serves as an indicator of this socioeconomic adversity. We 209 assessed the potential link between ADI and children‚Äôs intertemporal decision-making through 210 delay discounting at a 1-year follow-up. PLEs, encompassing distress, delusional, and 211 hallucinational symptoms, were evaluated at both 1-year and 2-year follow-ups. Our analysis 212 spans multiple follow-up periods and PLE indicators to investigate the sustained influence of 213 ADI over time and to explore differential associations with various PLE symptoms, particularly 214 delusional versus hallucinational. 215   216

    Results 217 The demographic characteristics of the final sample (N=2,135) are presented in Table 1. 218 Within the sample, 46.14% were female, 76.63% of participants had married parents, the mean 219 household income was $116,538, and 65.57% identified their race/ethnicity as white. 220 In our initial exploratory analysis, partial correlations were used to examine the 221 relationship between psychopathological symptoms and delay discounting. Among the 222 symptoms assessed (e.g., depression, anxiety, ADHD), only PLEs showed significant 223 correlation with delay discounting (Spearman œÅ = -0.067, p-FDR= 0.024 ~ œÅ = -0.057, p-FDR= 224 0.035) (Table S1). This finding underscores the unique association between PLEs and delay 225 discounting, laying the groundwork for subsequent investigations into how delay 226 discounting‚Äîalong with its genetic and neural correlates‚Äîmay be associated with the 227 heterogeneous relationship of neighborhood socioeconomic adversity with PLEs. 228  229 Neighborhood Socioeconomic Adversity is Associated with Steeper Delay 230 Discounting and Higher PLEs 231 IV Forest analyses suggested that a higher ADI has significant associations with a steeper 232 delay discounting (Œ≤= -1.73, p-FDR= 0.048) and a higher PLEs (distress score 1-year follow-233 up: Œ≤= 1.872, p-FDR= 0.048; distress score 2-year follow-up: Œ≤= 1.504, p-FDR= 0.039; 234 delusional score 1-year follow-up: Œ≤= 5.97, p-FDR= 0.048; delusional score 2-year follow-up: 235 Œ≤= 4.022, p-FDR=0.048; hallucinational score 1-year follow-up: Œ≤= 3.761, p-FDR= 0.048; 236 hallucinational score 2-year follow-up: Œ≤= 4.786, p-FDR=0.039) (Table 2). 237

    To evaluate the robustness of our findings from the IV Forest, we calculated the E-values 238 for the average relationships from the IV Forest. The E-values quantify the minimum strength 239 of association that unobserved confounders would need to possess with both ADI and the 240 outcomes, conditional on the observed covariates in the IV Forest model, to nullify the 241 observed relationships (68). E-values indicated that unobserved confounders would need to 242 have a relative risk greater than 9.13 for delay discounting and between 7.32 and 457.03 for 243 PLEs to account entirely for the observed effects (Table S2). This suggests a high threshold for 244 unobserved confounding effects, thereby strengthening the validity of our analyses. 245 Supplementary analyses employing a conventional linear IV regression (60) and an 246 alternative causal machine learning method, i.e., Double ML (69, 70), corroborated these 247 findings. The conventional IV regression also showed that ADI has negative relationship with 248 childhood delay discounting (Œ≤= -0.468, p-FDR= 0.03) and positive PLEs (distress score 1-249 year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.609, p-FDR= 0.011; distress score 2-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.78, p-FDR= 250 0.003; delusional score 1-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.486, p-FDR= 0.028; delusional score 2-year 251 follow-up: Œ≤= 0.578, p-FDR= 0.013; hallucinational score 1-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.604, p-FDR= 252 0.011; hallucinational score 2-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.827, p-FDR= 0.003). The partial-linear IV 253 model of the Double ML algorithm showed significant associations of ADI with children‚Äôs 254 delay discounting (Œ≤= -0.429, p-FDR= 0.044), distress score PLEs (1-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.495, 255 p-FDR= 0.023; 2-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.609, p-FDR= 0.005), hallucinational score PLEs (1-256 year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.498, p-FDR= 0.018; 2-year follow-up: Œ≤= 0.683, p-FDR= 0.002), and 2-257 year follow-up delusional score PLEs (Œ≤= 0.417, p-FDR= 0.044). The negative relationship of 258 ADI with 1-year follow-up delusional score PLEs were marginally significant (Œ≤= 0.393, p-259 FDR= 0.051). These results of the conventional linear IV regression (Table S3) and Double 260

    ML partial-linear IV regression (Table S4) are consistent with the findings obtained from the 261 IV Forest, further supporting the primary analyses and conclusions drawn from the study. 262  263 Genetic and Neural Correlates of Delay Discounting Moderates 264 Vulnerability to Neighborhood Socioeconomic Adversity 265 Next, we moved beyond the average relationships to test for heterogeneous associations 266 of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation: i.e., whether the associations of ADI with PLEs 267 varies systematically across children, and, if so, whether the heterogeneity is linked to 268 individual‚Äôs neurodevelopmental characteristics and the relevant genetic factors correlated to 269 intertemporal valuation. Conceptually, this is analogous to testing for an interaction, where the 270 associations of ADI with PLEs is moderated by, or differ as a function of a child's individual 271 genetic and neural markers. Unlike traditional models might test a few pre-specified 272 interactions, our IV Forest approach allows us to explore this heterogeneity in a data-driven 273 manner across a high-dimensional set of potential moderators, including GPS and structural 274 MRI and MID task functional MRI data. 275 To identify the best subset of genetic and neural correlates of delay discounting, we first 276 selected GPS and MRI brain regions of interest (ROIs) specifically related to delay discounting. 277 To analyze the nonparametric correlations of multiple input variables, we used a random forest-278 based feature selection Boruta algorithm (71). Its robustness and effectiveness in selecting 279 relevant features in high dimensional, intercorrelated biomedical data (e.g., MRI) has been 280 validated (71) and consistently applied in genetics and neuroscience research (72-74). The 281 variables significantly correlated with delay discounting (p-Bonferroni<0.05) were GPS of 282

    cognitive performance, IQ, and education attainment; morphometric features (e.g., surface area, 283 volume) in the limbic system (temporal pole, parahippocampal gyrus, caudate nucleus, rostral 284 anterior cingulate, isthmus cingulate), inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis), and fusiform 285 gyrus; mean beta activations of rewards/losses versus neutral feedback in the subcortical areas 286 (thalamus proper, ventral diencephalon), precentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, temporal lobe 287 (transverse temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus), and insula (Table S5).  288 We then assessed the heterogeneous associations of ADI with PLEs using three distinct IV 289 Forest models: (i) the Delay Discounting model, incorporating sociodemographic features and 290 delay discounting; (ii) the Gene-Brain model, which included sociodemographic features and 291 genetic and neural correlates of delay discounting (i.e., GPS and brain ROIs identified using 292 the Boruta algorithm); and (iii) the Integrated model which combined all the variables from the 293 previous two models (Fig. 1). All three models satisfied the overlap assumption (i.e., the 294 estimated propensity scores are not close to one or zero), which is crucial for the validity of the 295 estimated heterogeneous relationships (Fig. S1). In line with prior studies (75, 76), we obtained 296 conditional average effects, divided subjects into deciles (Q1: most vulnerable; Q10: most 297 resilient) based on the conditional average effects, and conducted three hypothesis tests (77) 298 on each model to determine the most effective model for capturing the individual differences 299 (heterogeneity) in the associations of ADI with PLEs: monotonicity, alternative hypothesis, and 300 ANOV A. 301 Among the three models, only the Integrated model showed significant individual 302 differences in the associations of ADI with PLEs. This was evident in the associations of ADI 303 with 1-year follow-up distress score PLEs (monotonicity test: p-FDR=0.011; alternative 304 hypothesis test: p=0.002; ANOV A test: p<0.001) and 1-year follow-up hallucinational score 305 

---PAGE BREAK---

    
    PLEs (monotonicity test: p-FDR=0.038; alternative hypothesis test: p=0.004; ANOV A test: 306 p<0.001), as presented in Fig. 3 and Table S6.  In contrast, the Delay Discounting model and 307 Gene-Brain model failed to pass the heterogeneity tests (monotonicity test: p-FDR‚â•0.05; 308 alternative hypothesis and ANOV A test: p‚â•0.05). 309 To elucidate the role of specific genetic and neural correlates within the heterogeneous 310 associations of ADI with PLEs, we obtained Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) scores (78). 311 SHAP scores provide insights into how each variable correlates positively or negatively to the 312 differential associations of ADI with 1-year follow-up observations of distress score and 313 hallucinational score PLEs. These scores help differentiate the roles of these factors across 314 subgroups, ranging from low to high conditional average effects, thereby providing a nuanced 315 understanding of how ADI is correlated with PLEs through various genetic and neural 316 pathways. 317 In both distress score and hallucinational score PLEs, children who showed higher levels 318 of ADI‚Äôs negative relationship with PLEs exhibited distinct neuroanatomical and functional 319 brain patterns, particularly in the limbic system. These patterns included reduced 320 neuroanatomical features such as smaller white matter and surface area in the right temporal 321 pole, reduced area and volume in the right parahippocampal region, decreased left white 322 surface area, smaller area in the right isthmus cingulate, reduced intracranial volume, smaller 323 caudate nucleus volume, and lower total grey matter volume. Functionally, greater activation 324 during MID tasks was observed in several areas including the posterior cingulate, right ventral 325 diencephalon, right insula, left thalamus proper, and left precentral gyrus. Additionally, 326 children more adversely affected by ADI, as indicated by higher conditional average effects on 327 PLEs, exhibited larger right fusiform volume, decreased activation in the left superior temporal 328

    gyrus, younger parental age, and lower BMI (Fig. S2). 329 The analysis also revealed that higher conditional average effects on distress score PLEs 330 was associated with higher cognitive performance GPS and a lower likelihood of being 331 Hispanic. In contrast, for hallucinational score PLEs, greater importance was attributed to 332 increased activation in the left supramarginal gyrus during MID tasks and more pronounced 333 discounting of future rewards. These nuanced associations are depicted in Fig. S2. 334 To further characterize this gene-environment interaction underlying these relationships, 335 we obtained conditional average effects of ADI on 1-year follow-up distress score PLEs, 336 conditioned on GPS for cognitive traits (i.e., cognitive performance, IQ, and education 337 attainment). Within the model, the estimated conditional average effects tended to increase with 338 higher values of GPSs (Fig. 4). This suggests that individuals with a higher genetic 339 predisposition for academic and cognitive achievement are paradoxically more vulnerable to 340 the psychotogenic effects of a deprived socioeconomic environment. 341 Given that quality control procedures reduced a large proportion of participants from the 342 initial ABCD Study cohort, we conducted sensitivity analysis using inverse probability 343 weighting to adjust for potential selection bias (see Supplementary Information for 344 methodological details). After inverse probability weighting adjustments, the heterogeneous 345 associations of ADI remained statistically significant for both distress (monotonicity: p-346 FDR=0.011; alternative hypothesis: p-FDR=0.002; ANOV A: p-FDR<0.001) and 347 hallucinational PLEs (monotonicity: p-FDR=0.038; alternative hypothesis: p-FDR=0.004; 348 ANOV A: p-FDR<0.001) at 1-year follow-up (Table S8). 349  350

    Discussion 352 In this study, we examined how neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation relates to 353 children‚Äôs intertemporal choice behavior (delay discounting) and PLEs, considering the 354 multifaceted associations of neighborhood adversity and its underlying biological, 355 environmental, and behavioral drivers. Our findings can be distilled into two main points. 356 Firstly, there was a notable link of living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods 357 to the propensity for children to prefer immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones‚Äîa 358 behavior known as steep delay discounting (indicative of lower impulse control) and to a higher 359 rate of PLEs. This association was significant even after adjusting for a range of observed 360 confounding factors (e.g., familial socioeconomic status) and reducing potential bias from 361 unobserved confounders via IV approach. Secondly, the associations of disadvantaged 362 neighborhood environments with PLEs were found to be heterogeneous. This individual 363 variability is moderated not just by delay discounting, but also by a confluence of factors 364 including genetic predisposition for cognitive intelligence, and brain morphometry and 365 functioning (task activation). Causal machine learning models utilized in our study have 366 identified a spectrum of conditions that either exacerbate vulnerability or contribute to 367 resilience, accounting for the diverse correlations of neighborhood environments with 368 children's PLEs. 369 Our findings hold implications for social science and economic theory by providing quasi-370 experimental evidence for the ‚Äúbehavioral poverty trap‚Äù. Our finding that neighborhood 371 socioeconomic adversity is linked to children‚Äôs intertemporal choice toward steeper reward 372 discounting challenges the longstanding economic assumption that time preference is a fixed 373

This environmentally induced shift towards more impulsive decision-making, likely 374 driven by factors such as cognitive load from resource scarcity and reduced social trust, could 375 foster behaviors that might perpetuate socioeconomic challenges. These results suggest that 376 policies aimed at improving childhood environments may be crucial for breaking 377 intergenerational cycles of disadvantage. A more detailed examination of these theoretical 378 frameworks is provided in the Supplementary Information. 379 A plausible biological mechanism for these findings involves the association of chronic 380 stress with the neurodevelopmental trajectory of prefrontal-limbic circuits. Prior research 381 indicates that neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation is a potent chronic stressor that elevates 382 glucocorticoid hormones like cortisol (79-83). During the critical adolescent period of our 383 cohort, prolonged glucocorticoid dysregulation can induce epigenetic modifications that alter 384 the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, which governs reward valuation and is heavily 385 implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis (33, 84-87). The neuro-genetic patterns of 386 vulnerability we identified‚Äîcharacterized by reduced limbic volume and altered prefrontal-387 limbic reactivity during reward processing‚Äîare therefore consistent with a stress-induced 388 disruption of the reward system that confers risk for both impulsive decision-making and PLEs 389 (24, 88). A more detailed review of the supporting evidence is available in the Supplementary 390 Information. 391 In our study, we discovered that children, when exposed to deprived neighborhoods and 392 already facing the challenges of residential disadvantage, were more likely to experience PLEs. 393 Surprisingly, these children also showed a higher GPS for cognitive performance, IQ, and 394 education attainment (Fig. 4). At first glance, this finding seems to contradict prior research, 395 which has consistently identified a negative relationship between PLEs and cognitive 396

    performance (38, 89). 397 We interpret this paradox through the lens of gene-environment interaction theory, 398 specifically the bioecological model and the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis (90-92). This framework 399 posits that genetic influences on traits diminish under adverse environmental conditions‚Äî400 analogous to how nutrient-poor soil constrains plant growth regardless of genetic potential (93). 401 In our context, residential disadvantage appears to suppress the protective effects of cognitive-402 related genetic variants, rendering children with higher cognitive ability GPS more vulnerable 403 to environmental stressors that precipitate PLEs. Critically, those with the greatest genetic 404 potential for cognitive performance lose the most protection, creating heightened susceptibility 405 to neighborhood-level adversity. 406 This interaction pattern aligns with differential susceptibility theory (94, 95), which 407 proposes that certain genetic profiles confer both vulnerability to negative environments and 408 enhanced benefit from positive ones. While our study of neighborhood deprivation captures 409 only the ‚Äúfor worse‚Äù component, our results satisfy a key theoretical prerequisite by providing 410 evidence that genetic advantage may paradoxically increase environmental vulnerability. This 411 challenges traditional diathesis-stress models and instead supports a genetic plasticity 412 framework where the same variants that confer advantage in supportive contexts create risk in 413 adverse ones. 414 The three GPSs examined here‚Äîencompassing cognitive performance, IQ, and 415 educational attainment‚Äîcapture accumulated learning and developmental potential (96, 97). 416 Within the differential susceptibility framework, elevated cognitive ability GPS may index 417 heightened neurobiological plasticity that, when confronted with resource-poor environments, 418

    generates stress responses that increase PLE risk. Conversely, individuals with lower cognitive 419 ability GPS may show resilience precisely because they exhibit reduced environmental 420 reactivity, making them less sensitive to the specific stressors‚Äîsuch as thwarted potential or 421 limited opportunities‚Äîthat characterize deprived neighborhoods and may trigger psychotic-422 like experiences. 423 Consistent with our findings, recent large-scale studies have demonstrated that the 424 association of genetics with brain structure, cognitive functions, and mental health disorders 425 becomes less significant in harmful environments (e.g., abuse) (98, 99). Conversely, in more 426 supportive and enriched settings, like those associated with higher socioeconomic status, 427 genetic influences are more noticeable (e.g., high socioeconomic status) (91, 100, 101). 428 Together with these findings, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of how genetic 429 and environmental factors interact to influence the development of psychopathology in children. 430 Several limitations of this study warrant consideration. First, while our IV approach was 431 employed to mitigate unobserved confounding, the observational nature of the ABCD Study 432 necessitates a cautious interpretation of causality. While we took steps to substantiate it with 433 prior research and sensitivity analyses (detailed in Instrumental Variable Regression section of 434 the Supplementary Information), our interpretations should be read as associations based on 435 IV-estimates that are compatible with a causal account but remain assumption‚Äëdependent.  436 Second, the stringent neuroimaging and behavioral quality‚Äëcontrol filters necessary for 437 internal validity yielded appreciable attrition from the ABCD Study cohort, introducing 438 potential selection effects. The final sample was predominantly white (65.57%, self-reported 439 race/ethnicity), which may also limit the generalizability of our specific neuro-genetic findings 440 

---PAGE BREAK---

    
    to individuals from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. To formally address this challenge, we 441 conducted a sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting, a rigorous method 442 designed to account for potential selection bias. While this sensitivity analysis demonstrated 443 that our key findings on heterogeneous associations of neighborhood adversity with PLEs were 444 robust to reweighting on observed characteristics, this approach cannot address selection on 445 unmeasured factors. Children excluded due to motion artifacts or task non-compliance may 446 differ in ways correlated with both neuroimaging quality and psychiatric vulnerability. 447 Therefore, our findings apply specifically to children capable of completing comprehensive 448 assessments‚Äîa limitation that may exclude those at highest risk. Future studies should develop 449 protocols enabling broader participation while maintaining data quality. 450 Third, the follow‚Äëup horizon is limited to baseline, 1‚Äëyear, and 2‚Äëyear assessments. It 451 should be noted that additional longitudinal data from the ABCD Study were publicly released 452 after this work was finalized, so were not included. Longer observation windows are needed to 453 map trajectories from adversity to psychosis‚Äëspectrum outcomes and to evaluate the stability 454 of heterogeneity signals. 455 Beyond neighborhood deprivation, testing other environmental risk factors as primary 456 exposures‚Äîparticularly parenting/ family environment (102) and early‚Äëlife stress (99)‚Äîwill 457 clarify whether similar neuro‚Äëgenetic profiles index differential susceptibility across contexts. 458 Later ABCD releases enable (i) time‚Äëvarying and cumulative‚Äëexposure models, (ii) 459 ancestry‚Äëstratified and site‚Äërobust analyses, and (iii) external replication. Such work will help 460 determine whether the identified moderators can support risk stratification and inform precision 461 prevention. 462

    This study highlights the differential associations of neighborhood disadvantage with 463 intertemporal economic decisions and PLEs during early childhood. It underscores the 464 importance of identifying diverse links by integrating genetic and environmental factors to 465 guide personalized healthcare approaches. Furthermore, we propose that enhancing the 466 childhood environment may contribute to the reduction of economic and health inequality gaps. 467 Economic policies promoting positive intertemporal choice (e.g., increased savings, healthy 468 diet) have predominantly focused on paternalistic welfare policies in adulthood. These policies 469 often assume that an individual‚Äôs tendency to discount future rewards is fixed (‚Äúexogenous‚Äù) 470 (24). However, our findings suggest that policies or interventions aimed at enhancing the 471 socioeconomic environment during childhood may foster improved intertemporal choice 472 behavior, thereby reducing economic (13, 20, 21) and health inequality (17, 103). By 473 addressing the root of the problem, this indirect approach may assist individuals in developing 474 the capacity to make more informed choices, ultimately promoting better outcomes. 475 Finally, our findings provide an empirical counterpoint to longstanding philosophical 476 questions about human agency. Immanuel Kant, in his book Critique of Practical Reason, 477 argued for an a priori capacity for reason, independent of external factors (104). Our work, 478 however, suggests that the neuro-genetic mechanisms governing intertemporal choice and 479 psychiatric vulnerability are profoundly associated with a child's socioeconomic environment. 480 This link between environment and the biological substrates of decision-making challenges 481 models of responsibility that assume unconstrained free will. Instead, our results call for a more 482 nuanced understanding of individual agency, suggesting that societal approaches to justice, 483 policy, and intervention must account for the powerful and heterogeneous ways in which a 484 child's environment is related with their neurocognitive development. 485

    Fig. 1. Study flow diagram. This figure illustrates the participant selection and data 996 processing in our study. We initially included 11,876 participants aged 9-12 years from the 997 Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, utilizing the release 4.0 dataset 998 which encompasses baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up observations. We 999 excluded observations not meeting the ABCD Study‚Äôs MRI quality control standards and those 1000 failing the Johnson-Bickel validation criterion for delay discounting. Participants with missing 1001 values in genotypes, MRI, NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, delay discounting, residential 1002 address, ADI, and PLEs were also removed. Subsequently, sociodemographic features 1003 underwent kNN imputation. This resulted in a final sample size of N=2,135. Using this cohort, 1004 our study first investigated the average associations of neighborhood socioeconomic 1005 deprivation with children‚Äôs intertemporal valuation of rewards and PLEs. We then explored the 1006 individual differences of these links in relation to children‚Äôs delay discounting behaviors and 1007 associated genetic and neural factors.  1008

    Fig. 2. Illustration of instrumental variables analysis. (A) Graphical model of the IV method. 1016 This panel depicts how the IV method is applied to address the potential biases from unobserved 1017 confounders U when analyzing the effects of exposure/treatment (ADI) on outcomes (delay 1018 discounting and PLEs) within the observational context of the ABCD Study. Using the 1019 instrument (SOI laws), the IV method aims to partial out the influence of U on ADI, thus 1020 adjusting for potential confounding biases. (B) Graphical representation of the IV Forest 1021 algorithm. The IV Forest algorithm stratifies subjects in a manner that maximizes the individual 1022 differences in predicted conditional average effects. This panel illustrates the use of IV Forest to 1023 assess the association of ADI with delay discounting and PLEs, as well as to explore the 1024 heterogeneous relationships of ADI with PLEs, factoring in individual variations in delay 1025 discounting and its associated genetic and neural correlates. 1026  1027

    Fig. 3. Delineation of heterogeneous associations by vulnerable/resilient subgroups. 1031 Heterogeneity in the associations of ADI with PLEs are shown as a bar plot, specifically focusing 1032 on 1-year follow-up distress score PLEs (A) and hallucinational score PLEs (B). These 1033 relationships are plotted across ten deciles, which are organized based on the relative 1034 vulnerability or resilience of the participants, with Q1 denoting the most vulnerable and Q10 1035 indicating the most resilient. Point estimates of the conditional average effect of each decile were 1036 derived via a doubly-robust estimation method within the IV Forest algorithm. 95% confidence 1037 intervals are depicted using error bars. 1038  1039

    Fig. 4. GPS for cognitive traits moderate environmental risk for PLEs. Plotted is the 1043 conditional average effects of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation (ADI) on distress score 1044 PLEs at 1-year follow-up. The effect of ADI is shown as a function of an individual's genetic 1045 predisposition (GPS) for (A) cognitive performance, (B) IQ, and (C) education attainment, 1046 revealing complex patterns of gene-environment interaction. 1047  1048  1049  1050  1051  1052  1053  1054  1055  1056
