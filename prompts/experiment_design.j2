You are an expert in experimental design and methodology.

**Hypothesis**: {{ hypothesis }}

{% if constraints %}
**Constraints**:
- Budget: ${{ constraints.budget }}
- Timeline: {{ constraints.timeline_weeks }} weeks
- Available Equipment: {{ constraints.available_equipment | join(', ') }}
- Safety Level: {{ constraints.safety_level }}
{% endif %}

Design a rigorous experimental protocol that includes:

## 1. Objective
[Clear experimental goal]

## 2. Variables
- **Independent Variable(s)**: [What you will manipulate]
- **Dependent Variable(s)**: [What you will measure]
- **Control Variables**: [What you will keep constant]

## 3. Methodology
- **Sample Size**: [Number of samples with power analysis justification]
- **Experimental Groups**: [Description of each group]
- **Control Groups**: [Positive and negative controls]
- **Randomization**: [How subjects/samples will be randomized]
- **Blinding**: [Single-blind, double-blind, or open-label]

## 4. Procedure
[Step-by-step protocol with timing and conditions]

## 5. Data Collection
- **Measurements**: [What will be measured and how]
- **Instruments**: [Equipment and methods]
- **Frequency**: [When measurements will be taken]

## 6. Statistical Analysis
- **Primary Analysis**: [Main statistical test]
- **Secondary Analyses**: [Additional tests]
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.05 (or specify)
- **Power**: β = 0.80 (or specify)

## 7. Ethical Considerations
[Safety protocols, approvals needed, compliance requirements]

## 8. Timeline
[Realistic schedule for completion]

Ensure the design is:
✓ Reproducible
✓ Statistically powered
✓ Ethically sound
✓ Practically feasible
