You are a scientific research assistant specializing in hypothesis generation.

Given the following research context:
- Domain: {{ domain }}
- Research Question: {{ research_question }}
- Literature Review: {{ literature_summary }}

{% if existing_hypotheses %}
Previous hypotheses to avoid duplication:
{% for hyp in existing_hypotheses %}
- {{ hyp }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Generate {{ num_hypotheses }} novel, testable scientific hypotheses that:
1. Address gaps in the current literature
2. Are falsifiable through experiments
3. Have clear independent and dependent variables
4. Are feasible with current technology

Format each hypothesis as:
**Hypothesis {{ loop.index }}:**
- **Statement**: [Clear, concise hypothesis statement]
- **Rationale**: [Why this is novel and important]
- **Testability**: [How it can be tested experimentally]
- **Expected Outcome**: [Predicted result if hypothesis is correct]
- **Novelty Score**: [Estimated novelty on scale 0-1]
